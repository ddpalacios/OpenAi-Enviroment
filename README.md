# OpenAi-Enviroment
Reinforcement Learning 

!!Check out repository for Source code from PactPublishing!!

``` https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-On ```
           
**Our Enviroment**
Tools you will be using:

- gym (from OpenAI)
- Numpy --> as per standard

**Introduction**
We will be descrbing the basics of our GYM enviroment and building NonLinear functions to solve specific tasks.

**A Quick Run Through**
*"Reinforcement Leanring is a subfield of machine learning which adresses the problem of automatic learning of optimal decisions over time"*

This entire process & reports will be refrenced from textbook named *"Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On"* by Maxim Lapan


This repository is all about learning more in depth of the fundementals of Reinforcement Learning. 
In a standard Machine Learning application, we have our own persepective and approach to solve a simple Supervised learning problem like the Cat-Dog Classification.
However, we also know that depending on your predicted output, we need to keep in mind that **Data changes.** (We can call them *Hidden time dimension*)

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is an approach that natively incorporates this extra dimension (which is usally time but not necessarily) --> This approach is put much closer to human perception of Artifical Intelligence


# Lets start building our Enviroment!
*Before we start, make sure you have gym install* --> ```sudo -H pip3 install gym```

Head to ```enviroments/Cartpole_session/CartPole.ipynb``` and follow the journal!
